# 🎯 Confidence Levels in AlphaFold2 Predictions

### ✅ High-Confidence Regions

* Regions with **high confidence scores** (e.g., pLDDT > 90) are generally **very close to experimentally determined structures**.
* These regions are **highly reliable** and serve as a **strong foundation** for:

  * Designing **downstream experiments**
  * Modeling **protein interactions**
  * Guiding **mutagenesis studies**

### ⚠️ Low-Confidence Regions

* Regions with **low confidence scores** may **deviate significantly** from the true structure.
* These are less reliable and should be interpreted cautiously in:

  * **Functional analysis**
  * **Structure-based drug design**
  * **Atomic-level modeling**

### 🧪 Limitations in Atomic Precision

* AlphaFold2 generally **gets the fold and most side chain positions right**.
* However, it may fall short in applications requiring **atomic-level precision**, such as:

  * Understanding **fine catalytic mechanisms**
  * Designing **transition state analogs**
  * Interpreting **subtle electrostatic or hydrogen-bond interactions**

 
## 📏 Measuring Accuracy Using RMSD

### 🔍 What is RMSD?

* **Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)** is used to assess the similarity between two protein structures by calculating the average distance between corresponding atoms after superposition.
* **Lower RMSD = Higher structural similarity**.
* Example benchmarks:

  * **RMSD = 0 Å** → Identical structures.
  * **RMSD > 2–3 Å** → Structures differ substantially.

### 📊 Comparative Accuracy

| Comparison Type                                       | Median RMSD | Interpretation                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Experimental vs. Experimental structure               | 0.6 Å       | Natural experimental variation      |
| AlphaFold2 vs. Experimental structure (overall)       | 1.0 Å       | Very good overall fold match        |
| AlphaFold2 vs. Experimental (high-confidence regions) | 0.6 Å       | On par with experimental structures |
| AlphaFold2 vs. Experimental (low-confidence regions)  | ≥ 2.0 Å     | Potentially substantial deviations  |

### 🔬 Side Chain Accuracy

| Measure                              | AlphaFold2 | Experimental Structures |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Side chains roughly correct          | 93%        | 98%                     |
| Side chains with perfect fit         | 80%        | 94%                     |
| Side chains not compatible with data | 7%         | 2%                      |

> ⚠️ **Note**: These statistics do **not apply** to disordered segments or **low-confidence regions**, where side chain conformations are mostly random.

*Figure 1. Phenylalanine hydroxylase.*  
While overall structural alignment is evident, several side chains (the smaller, branching structures extending from the main protein backbone) in the AlphaFold model (**AF-Q818B4-F1**) are positioned incorrectly compared to those in the deposited model (grey, **PDB ID: 7VGM**).



## 🧩 Interpreting Low-Confidence Regions and Domain Positioning in AlphaFold2

### 🔄 Low-Confidence ≠ Always Disorder

* **Low-confidence regions** in AlphaFold2 predictions often correlate with **intrinsically disordered regions**.
* However, they can also indicate **insufficient sequence or structural information** for confident predictions.

---

### 🔗 Domain Positioning Challenges

Proteins with multiple **domains connected by flexible linkers** present unique challenges:

* AlphaFold2 accurately predicts **individual domain structures** with **high local confidence (pLDDT)**.
* However, the **relative positioning** of domains may be:

  * **Random or highly variable**
  * **Biologically undefined** in isolation
  * **Only structured** within larger protein complexes

> 🧠 AlphaFold2 reflects this uncertainty via **low Predicted Aligned Error (PAE)** scores between domains.

### ⚠️ Implications for Biological Interpretation

| Scenario                            | Implication                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High pLDDT, low PAE between domains | Relative domain positioning is likely **inaccurate**                 |
| Flexible linkers between domains    | Domains may **not interact stably** in isolation                     |
| Membrane proteins                   | May show **clashes with membrane** due to lack of membrane awareness |

> 🛑 **Avoid drawing biological conclusions** from the predicted spatial arrangement of domains, especially when PAE indicates high uncertainty.
