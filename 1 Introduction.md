# **Protein**

## ðŸ§¬ What Are Proteins?

* **Proteins** are large, complex molecules that are **essential to all living organisms**.
* They are involved in **nearly every biological process**, such as:

  * Enzyme catalysis
  * Cell signaling
  * Immune responses
  * Structural support

## ðŸ§© Why Protein Structure Matters

* A proteinâ€™s **function is closely related to its 3D structure**.
* Understanding the structure helps scientists:

  * Predict function
  * Design drugs
  * Understand diseases

## ðŸ”¬ How Do We Determine Protein Structures?

Determining a proteinâ€™s structure is **challenging** and often requires specialized techniques:

| Method                                 | Description                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **X-ray Crystallography**              | Crystallizes the protein and diffracts X-rays through it to determine atomic structure. |
| **NMR Spectroscopy**                   | Uses magnetic fields to map atomic positions in small proteins.                         |
| **Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM)** | Freezes proteins in place and uses electron beams to build high-resolution images.      |
| **AI-based Predictions**               | Tools like AlphaFold use deep learning to predict structures from amino acid sequences. |
