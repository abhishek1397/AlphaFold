# **Protein**

## üß¨ What Are Proteins?

* **Proteins** are large, complex molecules that are **essential to all living organisms**.
* They are involved in **nearly every biological process**, such as:

  * Enzyme catalysis
  * Cell signaling
  * Immune responses
  * Structural support

## üß© Why Protein Structure Matters

* A protein‚Äôs **function is closely related to its 3D structure**.
* Understanding the structure helps scientists:

  * Predict function
  * Design drugs
  * Understand diseases

## üî¨ How Do We Determine Protein Structures?

Determining a protein‚Äôs structure is **challenging** and often requires specialized techniques:

| Method                                 | Description                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **X-ray Crystallography**              | Crystallizes the protein and diffracts X-rays through it to determine atomic structure. |
| **NMR Spectroscopy**                   | Uses magnetic fields to map atomic positions in small proteins.                         |
| **Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM)** | Freezes proteins in place and uses electron beams to build high-resolution images.      |
| **AI-based Predictions**               | Tools like AlphaFold use deep learning to predict structures from amino acid sequences. |

## The Struggle to Determine Protein Structures

For decades, experimental methods have enabled the determination of protein structures at atomic levels. Key breakthroughs in the 1950s and 60s allowed the use of **X-ray crystallography** and **nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)**. The 21st century saw the rise of **cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)**, especially after the "resolution revolution" (K√ºhlbrandt, 2014).

Despite advances, experimentally determining protein structure remains a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, involving numerous troubleshooting steps. This has led to a gap between the number of known **protein sequences** and **available protein structures**.

- As of January 2024, the **PDB** contains just over **215,000** experimental structures.
- Meanwhile, **UniProt** hosts approximately **250 million** protein sequences.
- 
> **Note:**
> **PDB (Protein Data Bank):** A repository of experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies.
> **UniProt:** A comprehensive database of protein sequence and functional information.

This disparity highlights the ongoing challenge in structural biology.

The gap between known protein sequences and available structures has widened significantly in recent years due to advances in DNA sequencing. Experimental methods for determining protein structures cannot keep up with the pace of sequencing, leading to millions of known proteins with unknown structures. It is crucial to develop methods to predict protein structures quickly and accurately in order to address this gap. AlphaFold has revolutionized the field by providing an effective and accurate way to predict protein structures.
